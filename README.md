Liquid Fire
===========

Comprehensive animation support for ambitious Ember applications.

## Features

- Animated transitions between routes that work seamlesssly with the
  Ember router.

- A DSL for laying out your spatial route relationships, cleanly
  separated from view-layer implementation details.

- Animated transitions between models within a single route.

- Animated transitions between individual scalar values within a
  template.

- Promise-driven API to control your animation flow.

- Backed by velocity.js, but easy to extend to other animation drivers
  if there's interest.
  

## Installation

This is an ember-cli addon, so all you need is:

    npm install --save-dev liquid-fire



### Documentation 

Liquid Fire itself is an ember-cli application that runs an
interactive demo & documentation. The docs are still being written,
but you can get a [sneak peak](http://ef4.github.io/liquid-fire).

You can also see some examples in my [Ember Animation Demo](http://github.com/ef4/ember-animation-demo) repo, and this [video presentation from the Boston Ember Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4M78SO3gAc).

<h1>Installing</h1>

<p>Using <a href="http://iamstef.net/ember-cli/">ember-cli</a> you can
install the liquid-fire addon with one of the following commands,
depending on your Ember version:</p>

For Ember &gt;= 1.11.0
<pre>ember install:addon liquid-fire</pre>

For Ember &lt; 1.11.0
<pre>ember install:addon liquid-fire@^0.17.0</pre>

<div class="callout callout-info">

  If you're not using ember-cli, you are <a
  href="https://github.com/ef4/liquid-fire/issues/170">getting hard
  for plugin authors to support</a>, and I don't have a premade
  solution for you at this time. I think we can make a
  general-purpose tool for exporting standlone builds of Ember addons,
  but so far it hasn't been written.

<h4>Supported Ember Versions and Semver</h4>

<p>The <code>master</code> liquid-fire branch is compatible with Ember 1.11.0
  through canary, and is released as the newest available liquid-fire
  version on npm.</p>

<p>The <code>oldstable</code> liquid-fire branch is compatible with Ember 1.8.1
  through 1.10.0 and is released on npm as the 0.17.x series. It will
  continue to receive high priority bugfixes, but new features are
  only happening on master.</p>

<p>As liquid-fire is still pre-1.0, you can expect breaking changes,
which will be described in the <a
href="https://github.com/ef4/liquid-fire/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a>. We
plan to stabilize the API and publish a 1.0 beta in conjunction with
the Ember 2.0 beta in June 2015.</p>
